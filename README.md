# rewilding2021
This repository contains the data and code from Oyesola et al. (20??) and Downie et al. (20??).
The data include both immunological data (e.g. flow cytometry results describing cell type distributions,
complete blood count results, cytokine levels) and behavioral data in the form of check-in
records across the rewilding period.  Metadata is also included.

The code provides the necessary information to process the data and analyze it, as well as code for
reproducing most of the plots.  It also provides the code that is used in our behavior monitoring
system.  The former is in R; the latter is in Python.

If you have questions about the data or methods, please contact the corresponding authors of the relevant
manuscript.  If you have further questions about the behavior monitoring system, please e-mail Jesse Saunders
('jbs' at 'princeton.edu').
